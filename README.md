This Crypto-Tracker App has the main goal to track the development of different crypto-coins (at the moment about 200).

### The idea is to track at least:

- Active Markets
- Total of Market Capital
- Total Volume in 24h

3. For Each Crypto:

- Different Price in USD, EUR ...
- Change in 1h, 24h, 7 Days, Market Cap, Volume 24 h

## UI-Interface

- Filled with tables, graphics as bar, chart, line, pie
- It should be completely responsive

## Technologies

We are using:

- Angular
- Typescript
- ngx-translator
- API's for fetch data as: CoinLore, Exchange
- PrimeNG for UI-Components
- SASS

And To keep the same standard code between programmers we are using:

> - Prettier: for code auto formatter
> - ESLint: to find and fix problems in the code
> - Karma + Jasmine: to make test
> - Travis CI: for continuous integration
